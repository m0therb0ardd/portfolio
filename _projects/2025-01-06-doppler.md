## Overview


I've always been deeply drawn to and inspired by the movement and patterns of ripples and wave. For this visual coding project, I used Processing for the first time to create dynamic ripples that expand outward from the mouse cursor with each click. Using object-oriented programming, I designed the ripples to grow and fade gradually, mimicking natural motion.

Iâ€™m now building on this simple design, exploring ways to synchronize the ripples with sound to create a more immersive, multisensory experience.
