## Project Overview

This project explores how human movement can shape the collective behavior of robotic swarms. Drawing from Laban Movement Analysis, I am building a real-time pose classification pipeline that identifies movement qualities (such as float vs. punch) from a dancer’s body.

The system integrates MediaPipe-based pose tracking with a machine learning classifier to label movement phrases. These classifications are then broadcast into a multi-agent swarm simulation, where 50 robots translate human dynamics into emergent group behaviors such as flocking, orbiting, or dispersing.

By linking dance notation and robotics, the project creates a call-and-response choreography between human performers and machines. My goal is to test how movement qualities, rather than predefined gestures, can guide collective robotic action
