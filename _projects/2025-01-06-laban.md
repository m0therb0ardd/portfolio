## Project Overview

This performance explores the evolving relationship between a human dancer and a swarm of robots through a **gesture-classification model that interprets the dancer’s effort qualities** and a **choreographic swarm system that translates those interpretations into collective robotic behavior**.

## System Overview
The system transforms the dancer’s movement into real-time swarm behavior by capturing video from a front-facing camera, extracting body landmarks with MediaPipe, and classifying each 2-second movement window using a Laban-inspired Random Forest model. Each predicted movement quality then triggers a corresponding algorithm on the Coachbot swarm, allowing the robots to collectively express that movement quality through distinct, choreographed swarm algorithms.

## The Coachbot Platform 

The performance uses Coachbot V2.0 mobile robots developed at Northwestern for large-scale swarm experiments. Each robot is approximately 12 cm tall with a 10 cm diameter and equipped with a Raspberry Pi B+ for onboard computation
and a built-in localization system based on the HTC Vive tracking framework

       style="width: 30%; max-width: 1000px; height: auto; border-radius: 5px; filter: grayscale(100%);">
</div>


The larger research arena includes an HTC Vive base station for global localization and an overhead camera used for recording. 

Coachbots communicate through a layered network consisting of:
- an Ethernet link from the base station to a Wi-Fi router
- TCP/IP connections between the router and robots
- layer-2 broadcast messages for fast swarm-wide coordination

## Laban Movement Overview


Laban Movement Analysis (LMA) is a framework used across dance, choreography, and somatic practice to describe and understand human movement. Developed by Rudolf Laban and later expanded by Irmgard Bartenieff, the system organizes movement into four interrelated categories:

**Body** —  how different parts of the body participate in the action

**Effort** — the dynamic qualities of a movement: its energy, texture, and the manner in which it unfolds

**Shape** — how the body changes form and what motivates those changes

**Space** — the pathways and directional choices a movement traces through the environment

Laban combined Space, Weight, and Time into what he called the Effort Actions or Action Drive. These combinations create eight named efforts: Float, Punch (Thrust), Glide, Slash, Dab, Wring, Flick, and Press.

## Gesture Classifier 
The gesture classifier focuses on four of the eight Effort Actions— **Float, Punch, Glide, and Slash**—each selected for their expressive contrast and their ability to be embodied clearly by both human and robot movement. (Note: The first four gestures appear in the performance as choreographic elements and are not themselves derived from Laban analysis.)

Using the Laban Effort Action Method, the dancer performed roughly 80 phrases for each of the four efforts, providing the classifier with consistent, intentional examples that captured both gesture form and expressive quality. 
![Frames]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/all_gestures_gif.gif)


Each phrase was represented as a feature vector including:
- Kinematic features (velocity, accel, jerk)
- Spatial features (ranges, positions, deltas)
- Geometric features (path length, straightness)
- Normalization features (relative to hip/shoulder)

    <img src="/assets/images/laban_features.png">

</div>
The resulting random forest classifier successfully learned distinguishing patterns across the four efforts. **Float** often appears as low-velocity motion with gentle directional variability, while **Punch** is characterized by sharp velocity spikes and strong directional commitment. **Glide** maintains smooth, sustained timing with direct spatial pathways, whereas **Slash** shows quick, forceful movement with more spatially indirect trajectories.

  <img src="/assets/images/shapes.png" alt="laban efforts" style="width: 75%; max-width: 1000px; height: auto; border-radius: 5px;">
</div>


During performance, the classifier runs continuously. Every two seconds, it outputs a predicted effort label, which then triggers a corresponding swarm behavior. In this way, the dancer’s movement becomes a real-time choreographic score, dynamically shaping how the swarm organizes, disperses, or transforms its collective motion.

## Swarm Algorithms 
The swarm algorithms were designed as creative interpretations of Laban Effort qualities, translations of human expressive dynamics into fully distributed robotic behaviors. Each algorithm began in simulation, where considerations such as shape, directionality, flow, and effort quality guided both the control logic and the emergent group patterns.

Encircling, Float, and Slash are the three most complex and visually dynamic algorithms, each crafted to evoke a distinct movement quality while maintaining decentralized control across the swarm. Additional choreographed behaviors (Left. Right, Glitch, Punch, Glide, etc.) are documented on github but the following three form the expressive core of the system.

<!-- 
#### Directional Left/Right
A rigid-body translation where the swarm computes its own center of mass and then slides together mainting its formation. 
- Distributed COM estimation: Robots exchange small heartbeat packets (x, y, id) to estimate a shared center-of-mass in ~3 seconds without any global controller.
- Relative offset locking: Each robot saves its personal offset (dx, dy) from the estimated COM, guaranteeing shape preservation during the translation.
- Time-parameterized movement: The formation center interpolates from C0 to Cfinal over a fixed duration, guaranteeing synchronized motion across robots.
- Soft-wall repulsion: A continuous force term pushes robots away from arena boundaries, maintaining safety without abrupt stopping.

#### Glitch
The Glitch behavior embodies disruption, fragmentation, and sharp irregularity in the swarm. It introduces temporal randomness and abrupt radial bursts that break the flow of the swarm and create a feeling of instability.
- Each robot begins idle, then selects a random delay (2–8 seconds) before activating, creating desynchronized motion across the swarm.
- When activated, the robot computes the radial direction away from the arena center and turns toward it using a proportional controller.
- It performs a sharp outward burst, moving exactly 6 inches beyond its starting radius at a high, fixed speed.
- Once it reaches its target distance, the robot stops and freezes in place, signaling completion with a green LED.

#### Encircling
The Encircling behavior creates a coordinated vortex around the dancer, where the swarm self-organizes into two concentric rings. The inner ring moves counterclockwise while the outer ring moves clockwise, producing a braided, ribbon-like motion that wraps the human performer in a dynamic orbit.
- At startup, each robot measures its distance from the arena’s center, assigning itself to either the inner or outer ring based solely on this initial radius—no communication or central coordinator is required.
- Each robot computes the correct tangential direction for its ring: the inner ring rotates counterclockwise, while the outer ring rotates clockwise, ensuring the two layers weave past each other without collision.
- Throughout the motion, robots continuously correct their radial position using a proportional controller, pulling themselves back toward the ideal ring while maintaining tangential velocity to sustain the orbit.
- Soft-wall boundary logic modulates forward speed near edges and halts the robot if it enters a critical zone, preserving safety while keeping the encirclement smooth and coherent.

#### Glide
Glide expresses Laban’s light, sustained, indirect effort quality. Instead of sharp bursts or impacts, Glide produces a continuous, graceful motion in which the swarm moves together like a drifting, rippling organism. The robots maintain fixed relative positions, following a shared moving “wave center” that oscillates laterally and slowly rises through the arena.
- When Glide is activated, the robots first exchange short heartbeat messages to estimate the swarm’s collective center of mass (COM). Each robot records its own offset from this shared center—its “place in the ring.”
- Once the COM is established, the robot enters continuous Glide:
- The COM begins to drift upward while oscillating side-to-side in a gentle sine wave.
- Each robot follows this moving COM while maintaining its original offset, creating a rigid, drifting ring that moves as a single body.

#### Punch
Punch is designed around Laban’s strong, quick, direct effort quality. In the swarm, Punch becomes a coordinated wave of force: robots align downward, aim precisely, and then execute a sharp forward dash. The behavior emphasizes commitment, acceleration, and impact — a robotic equivalent of a decisive, forceful strike.
- Robots continuously exchange pulse messages; receiving a new pulse triggers a punch cycle.
- Upon activation, a robot aims toward a downward heading (–90°) with slight random jitter, aligning itself for a direct strike.
- After a short aiming phase, the robot enters a high-speed dash lasting ~1.2 seconds, moving strongly and directly downward.
- A cool down interval prevents the robot from punching repeatedly, creating rhythmic waves of motion across the swarm.
- Boundary checks ensure safety; robots near the arena edge trigger a global stop signal.

####  Float
The Float behavior evokes lightness, indirectness, and gentle wandering. Robots drift as if carried by invisible currents, weaving softly through the space with subtle oscillations and loose flocking interactions that produce an airy, dreamlike motion.
- Robots apply a global upward drift paired with a sinusoidal side-to-side wave, creating a motion field that feels buoyant and fluid rather than directional or forceful.
- A soft flocking system—separation, cohesion, and alignment—keeps robots loosely gathered without locking them into a rigid structure, allowing the swarm to breathe and expand organically.
- Wave phases differ between robots, producing asynchronous lateral sway that gives the swarm a shimmering, floating quality rather than synchronized oscillation.
- Boundary forces gently nudge robots inward when they stray near arena walls, preserving the soft wandering motion while preventing collisions; if a robot reaches a critical boundary it stops safely.

#### Slash 
The Slash behavior is forceful, fast, and diagonally peeling. Robots carve sharp, sweeping paths through the space, accelerating along angled trajectories while breaking uniformity with sudden zig-zags and drifting arcs. The motion feels heavy and decisive — a cutting gesture that slices across the swarm rather than flowing with it.
- Robots begin by exchanging positions to estimate the swarm’s center and dynamically split into inner and outer groups. Each group is assigned a different vertical migration target, causing the whole formation to shear apart in opposing diagonal directions.
- During the main slash motion, each robot follows its ring path upward or downward while adding a sharp tangential component created from two sources: a high-frequency zig-zag oscillation and a directional drift away from the swarm’s centerline. Together, these produce the characteristic diagonal, slicing feel.
- An anti-jam tangential repulsion term pushes robots sideways relative to the ring whenever they approach neighbors too closely, preventing head-on collisions and reinforcing the sense of bodies cutting past one another.
- When the migration phase ends, robots enter a correction state that removes the zig-zag and drift, pulling each bot cleanly back into its proper ring position. Boundary conditions continuously enforce safety, while ring-based LEDs visually distinguish the two diagonally splitting layers. -->


## Gratitude

This project is rooted in a deep appreciation for human movement and expression. Choreographing this duet between dancer and robots has become an act of reverence for the subtle ways humans communicate through gesture, through motion, through shared attention and empathy.

 Swarm behavior in nature offers such powerful examples of emergent coordination, care, and collective resilience. These systems are not just biologically interesting; they are politically meaningful, especially now. Studying swarm dynamics is, in its own way, a study of how groups survive, resist, and move together through constraint.

I also want to acknowledge the technologies and tools, including large language models, that have supported an enormous amount of learning and debugging throughout this project. None of this work exists in isolation. It emerges from a network of resources, labor, and knowledge, human and nonhuman that I hold with deep gratitude.

I want to honor that network here:
Thomas DeFrantz, whose work grounds this project in practices of liberation through movement. Matt Elwin, my project advisor in the MSR program, whose robotics expertise and care for students' growth shaped this journey. Vaishnavi Dornadula, who granted me access to the Coachbot platform she built and maintains. Emma Bernstein, who held a constant light to my love for this work. Eden Naftali and Sam Mayers, who held my hand as I moved toward challenges. Lily Sharatt, for her creative being and the composition that accompanies the recording. My family, who remain constant supporters of everything that brings me joy. And my entire cohort, whose curiosity continues to inspire me, especially Pushkar, my desk mate.

## Performance Overview

The duet begins with direct and mappable gestures. A hand extends left and the robots follow. A gesture extends right and the robots follow. The system is legible, obedient, and predictable.

As the performer’s movements become more expressive, this clarity dissolves. A soft gesture to the left and an abrasive punch may trace similar spatial paths, but their intentions differ sharply. The system—still relying on positional data alone cannot perceive these differences. It responds inadequately, continuing to treat both as identical directional inputs.

The antithesis of the piece unfolds in this breakdown of communication. The swarm begins to struggle: some robots freeze, others glitch or fall out of sync. The dancer reaches a moment of embodied frustration and collapses into stillness. Human intention and machine interpretation have drifted too far apart.

Then, slowly, the robots begin to reorganize themselves. One by one, they encircle. This moment marks a shift from breakdown to reconnection. A new movement language emerges, one informed by Laban’s theory of effort, where motion is understood not just by where it goes, but by how it feels: light or strong, direct or indirect, sustained or quick.

By the end, the system no longer mirrors gesture. Instead, it participates in a more nuanced exchange where meaning is continuously negotiated through movement. Human and swarm learn to meet each other halfway, creating a shared, evolving dialogue shaped equally by expression and computation. -->
