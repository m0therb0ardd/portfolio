## Project Overview

In my current project, I am building a machine learning pipeline to classify expressive dance movements based on Laban Movement Analysis (LMA), focusing initially on effort qualities such as "float" and "punch." Using pose estimation and motion-derived features (velocity, acceleration, jerk), I am training classifiers to detect dominant movement qualities from real-time or recorded dance footage.

The first phase of the project focuses on motion analysis and classification. After completing the ML system, I will integrate it with a group of TurtleBot3 robots to create an immersive, responsive robotic swarm. Each robot behavior will reflect the dancer’s expressive state — using decentralized swarm algorithms to dynamically embody the movement qualities identified by the model.
