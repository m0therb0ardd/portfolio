        I earned my Bachelor of Science in Operations Research from Columbia University, where I focused on optimization techniques and decision-making frameworks to design systems that facilitate the efficient movement of people through space. This foundation deepened my fascination with movement and embodiment—how we navigate and express ourselves within physical spaces and through our bodies.

        After graduating, I worked for two years with the data analytics team at Planned Parenthood of Illinois, where I focused on maximizing patient access to vital healthcare services in the aftermath of the Dobbs decision. That experience strengthened my commitment to bodily autonomy and underscored the profound connections between movement, accessibility, and human resilience.

        Now pursuing a Master of Science in Robotics at Northwestern University, I am exploring how robotic performance can challenge and redefine our perceptions of embodiment. My work delves into themes of bodily autonomy and expression, drawing on my interests in performance art, kinetic sculpture, and interactive media.
