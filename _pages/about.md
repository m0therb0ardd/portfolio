      <p>
        I earned my Bachelor of Science in Operations Research from Columbia University, where I focused on optimization techniques and decision-making frameworks to design systems that facilitate the efficient movement of people through space. This foundation deepened my fascination with movement and embodiment—how we navigate and express ourselves within physical spaces and through our bodies.

      <p>
        After graduating, I spent two years working with the data analytics team at Planned Parenthood of Illinois, where I focused on maximizing patient access to vital healthcare services in the aftermath of the Dobbs decision. That experience strengthened my commitment to bodily autonomy and underscored the profound connections between movement, accessibility, and human  resilience.

      <p>
         I am now pursuing a Master of Science in Robotics at Northwestern University, exploring how robotic performance can challenge and play with our sense of embodiment. My current work centers on themes of bodily autonomy, a value that became deeply important to me during my time at Planned Parenthood. I am particularly interested in creative applications of robotics, including performance art, kinetic sculpture, and interactive media.
